# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project
## Introduction
This project focuses on performing advanced data analytics on NYC taxi data by leveraging modern data engineering tools and technologies. The objective is to design and implement a scalable pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and analyzing trip data, ultimately delivering actionable insights using GCP services and analytics tools.

## Architecture
The architecture involves integrating multiple GCP services and modern data tools to build an end-to-end data engineering workflow. Key components include:

## Ingestion and storage of raw trip data.
Data cleaning and transformation using a modern pipeline tool.
Analytics and visualization of results using BigQuery and Looker Studio.
## Technology Used
### Programming Language:
Python
Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

**Google Storage:** Storing raw and processed trip data.

**Compute Instance:** Running ETL/ELT jobs and custom Python scripts.

**BigQuery:** Executing SQL queries on large datasets for analytics.

### Visualization:

**Looker Studio:** Creating dashboards and visualizations for actionable insights.
Modern Data Pipeline Tool:

**Mage:** Building, orchestrating, and automating ETL/ELT pipelines for efficient data workflows.

## Key Objectives
Ingest NYC taxi data into GCP storage.
Build and automate data pipelines using Mage for transformation.
Analyze and query data using BigQuery for meaningful insights.
Visualize findings in Looker Studio for better decision-making.
