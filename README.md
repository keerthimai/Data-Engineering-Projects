üöÄ Data Engineering Projects
Welcome to my Data Engineering Projects repository! This is where I explore, build, and document hands-on projects across different areas of data engineering, showcasing practical implementations of tools, technologies, and concepts.

üåü What You'll Find
This repository contains a collection of projects covering various aspects of data engineering, including:

Data Pipelines: Building ETL/ELT pipelines using tools like Apache Airflow.
Data Warehousing: Designing and implementing data warehouses with BigQuery.
Big Data Processing: Hands-on with Spark, Hadoop, or Kafka for processing large-scale datasets.
Cloud Integration: Using cloud service GCP for data engineering workflows.
Database Design: Implementing relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
Data Streaming: Working with real-time data using Apache Kafka.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Some of the tools and technologies used in these projects:

Programming: Python, SQL, Scala
Big Data: Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka
Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
Cloud Platforms: Google Cloud Platform
Workflow Orchestration: Apache Airflow,  Dagster
Data Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib
üìÇ Project Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder with:

Project Documentation: A detailed explanation of the problem, approach, and results.
Code Files: Scripts, notebooks, and configuration files.
Sample Data: If applicable, datasets used for the project (or links to them).
Setup Instructions: Guidance to reproduce the project.
üéØ Purpose
This repository serves as:

A learning journal to deepen my understanding of data engineering concepts.
A portfolio to demonstrate my skills in real-world scenarios.
A resource for others looking to learn or get inspired by data engineering projects.
